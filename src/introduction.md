# Introduction 

These lectures offer a great introduction to many interesting topics in mathematics. 
Each topic builds on the previous one and offer a smooth progression.

The target audience is physicists and so all proof of theorem are not provided.
Yet the lectures will give you a solid understanding of the presented topics.

The lectures start by introducting [propositional logic](./propositional_logic.md) as the fundamental tool to 
develop [axiomatic set theory](./axiomatic_set_theory.md).

The axioms of [axiomatic set theory](./axiomatic_set_theory.md) are then presented.

Once we have properly defined sets, we start building [topology](./topology.md)
